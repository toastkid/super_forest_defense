Super Forest Defense
------------------------
A game made by Max Williams and Jonny Martyr for MolyJam 2012 Brighton - http://www.whatwouldmolydeux.com/

Inspired by a @PeterMolydeux tweet "What if you could plant seeds that grow into cover systems?"

Usage
----------------
In order to play this you need to have installed CoronaSDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/) and then load main.lua into the Corona Simulator, in iPhone 3 mode (it might work in iPhone 4 mode too but i haven't tested it).

Playing instructions
---------------------
Grow trees to defend the earth from a meteor shower.  Trees planted close to one another will slow each other down so grab the seeds before they hit the ground and spread them out.  There's no "win" condition - the meteors get bigger and more frequent until they inevitably overwhelm you.  Just survive as long as you can - it's emotional gaming, man.
