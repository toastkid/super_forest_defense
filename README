In order to play this you need to have installed CoronaSDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/) and then load main.lua into the Corona Simulator, in iPhone 3 mode (it might work in iPhone 4 mode too but i haven't tested it).

Playing instructions:  Grow trees to defend the earth from a meteor shower.  Trees planted close to one another will slow each other down so grab the seeds before the hit the ground and spread them out.

Inspired by a @molydeux tweet "What if you could plant seeds that grow into cover systems?"
